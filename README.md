_A responsive front-end framework for building modern websites_

## What is the purpose?
In all honesty, this being a _shoddy_ framework and all, I really just wanted something to do and I decided making a CSS framework would be fun.

## Goals
 - To be a functional, flexible, and responsive CSS framework
 - To be easily usable by anyone

## Where can I find documentation?
The documentation and API are still being worked on, but you can find work-in-progress documentation at [the official shoddy.css website](http://www.compii.net/shoddycss/).
