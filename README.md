# shoddy.css
A shoddy, yet flexible and lightweight, front-end CSS framework

## What is the purpose?
In all honesty, this being a _shoddy_ framework and all, I really just wanted something to do and I decided making a CSS framework would be fun.

## Goals
 - To be a functional, flexible, and responsive CSS framework
 - To be easily usable by anyone
